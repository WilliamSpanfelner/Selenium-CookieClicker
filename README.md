# Selenium & CookieClicker Automation
- 👋 Hi, I’m @WilliamSpanfelner
- 👀 I’m interested in using Python with Swift in iOS environments and why it may or may not be desirable.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more Python with the London App Brewery and Angela Yu's [100 Days of Code: 
The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Udemy.  

- 🧑‍💻 Selenium is another web-scraping tool that also allows automation with regard to form filling, button
clicking, scrolling etc.  This Python project has a variety of examples illustrating the use of some common
features, and if you like cookies, well lets just say you might find yourself in seventh heaven.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on application development.
